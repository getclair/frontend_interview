Given an array of movie objects (found in the movieData.js file), write a function that will determine which actor made the most money from their movies. 
Each actor in a movie receives an equal percent of the box office earnings. 
For example, if BoxOffice was $100 and there were 3 actors, each actor would get $33.33.
The function should return the actorâ€™s name and their earnings as a string.
