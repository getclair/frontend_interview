/**
Given an array of movie objects (found in the movieData.js file), write a function that will determine which actor made the most money from their movies. 
Each actor in a movie receives an equal percent of the box office earnings. 
For example, if BoxOffice was $100 and there were 3 actors, each actor would get $33.33.
The function should return the actorâ€™s name and their earnings as a string.

a = #actors
Time: O(m*a^floor(a,m))
Space: O(a) - Each actor gets a spot in the mapping with a constant size value
